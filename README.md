> **One-stop install/update reference**: [`spec/01-app/108-cross-platform-install-update.md`](spec/01-app/108-cross-platform-install-update.md) — the full Windows / macOS / Linux install · update · uninstall · verify matrix is also rendered in the docs at `/install-gitmap`.

## Quick Start

### Install — Quick (pick your install folder)

Prompts for the install drive/folder (press Enter for the default), then runs the full installer.

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/main/install-quick.ps1 | iex
```

#### Linux / macOS

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/main/install-quick.sh | bash
```

### Install — Full (defaults, no prompt)

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/main/gitmap/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

#### Linux / macOS

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/main/gitmap/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

> **How install resolves a version:** every installer follows the generic contract in [`spec/07-generic-release/09-generic-install-script-behavior.md`](spec/07-generic-release/09-generic-install-script-behavior.md). In short — **strict tag mode** (`--version <tag>` / `-Version <tag>`) installs that exact release with **no fallback whatsoever** (no `latest`, no sibling probe, no main-branch HEAD; missing tag → exit 1). **Discovery mode** (no tag supplied) probes the next 20 `-v<N+i>` sibling repos in parallel, then falls back to `releases/latest`, and finally to the default branch HEAD as a last resort.

### Uninstall — Quick (one-liner)

Removes the gitmap binary, deploy folder, PATH entries, and (optionally) the user data folder. First tries the canonical `gitmap self-uninstall`; falls back to a manual sweep if gitmap is no longer on PATH.

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/main/uninstall-quick.ps1 | iex
```

#### Linux / macOS

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/main/uninstall-quick.sh | bash
```

Useful flags (both scripts):

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-Yes` / `-y` `--yes` | Skip the "delete user data?" prompt and assume yes |
| `-KeepData` / `--keep-data` | Always keep `%APPDATA%\gitmap` (Windows) or `~/.config/gitmap` (Unix) |
| `-InstallDir` / `--dir` | Override the auto-detected deploy root |

### Scan repos and see results

```bash
gitmap scan ~/projects
gitmap ls
```

The `[dir]` argument accepts **relative paths** and resolves them against
your current working directory. Common shortcuts:

```bash
gitmap scan .          # scan the current directory
gitmap scan ..         # scan the parent directory
gitmap scan ../..      # scan two folders up
gitmap scan ../../x    # scan the "x" folder two levels up
gitmap scan ~/work     # "~" expands to your home directory
```

When the resolved path differs from what you typed, gitmap prints a
one-line `↳ Resolved "<input>" → <abs>` hint so the target is
unambiguous. Non-existent paths exit early with a clear error instead of
silently falling back to the current directory.

### Navigate and pull

```bash
gitmap cd my-api
gitmap pull --all
```

Every command supports `--help` or `-h` for detailed usage with examples.

## Installation

### One-Liner Install (recommended)

Quick installers prompt for an install folder, then delegate to the full installer.

#### Windows (PowerShell) — Quick

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/main/install-quick.ps1 | iex
```

#### Linux / macOS — Quick

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/main/install-quick.sh | bash
```

#### Windows (PowerShell) — Full bootstrap (works on any machine)

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/main/gitmap/scripts/install.ps1'))
```

#### Windows (PowerShell 5+) — Short form

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/main/gitmap/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

#### Linux / macOS (Bash)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/main/gitmap/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

### Installer Options

**Windows (PowerShell):**

| Flag | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-Version` | Pin a specific release | `-Version v2.51.0` |
| `-InstallDir` | Custom install directory | `-InstallDir C:\tools\gitmap` |
| `-Arch` | Force architecture (`amd64`, `arm64`) | `-Arch arm64` |
| `-NoPath` | Skip adding to user PATH | `-NoPath` |
| `-AllowFallback` | Use newest patch in same vMAJOR.MINOR if version missing | `-AllowFallback` |

**Linux / macOS (Bash):**

| Flag | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--version` | Pin a specific release | `--version v2.55.0` |
| `--dir` | Custom install directory | `--dir /opt/gitmap` |
| `--arch` | Force architecture (`amd64`, `arm64`) | `--arch arm64` |
| `--no-path` | Skip adding to PATH | `--no-path` |
| `--allow-fallback` | Use newest patch in same vMAJOR.MINOR if version missing | `--allow-fallback` |

#### Non-Interactive / CI Installations

When installing via pipe (`irm ... | iex` or `curl ... | bash`), the terminal
is **non-interactive**. If the requested version is missing, the installer
**exits with code 1** without prompting.

To handle missing versions in automated environments:

1. **Use `--allow-fallback`** — Automatically picks the newest patch in the same
   minor series (e.g., `v3.38.0` requested but missing → uses `v3.38.5`):
   ```powershell
   irm https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/releases/download/v3.38.0/release-version-v3.38.0.ps1 | iex
   # Or with generic script:
   irm https://gitmap.dev/scripts/release-version.ps1 | iex; Install-Gitmap -Version "v3.38.0" -AllowFallback
   ```

2. **Pre-validate the version** — Use `gitmap list-versions` to confirm existence
   before installing.

#### Version-Specific Install Scripts

For reproducible installs, use the **per-version snapshot scripts** that are
 baked with the version at release time:

| Script | URL Pattern |
|--------|-------------|
| Pinned PowerShell | `https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/releases/download/{version}/release-version-{version}.ps1` |
| Pinned Bash | `https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/releases/download/{version}/release-version-{version}.sh` |
| Generic PowerShell | `https://gitmap.dev/scripts/release-version.ps1` (requires `-Version` param) |
| Generic Bash | `https://gitmap.dev/scripts/release-version.sh` (requires `--version` flag) |

**Specific version install (one-liner with fallback):**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/main/gitmap/scripts/install.ps1 | iex; Install-Gitmap -Version "v2.51.0"
```

**Specific version + custom directory (one-liner):**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/main/gitmap/scripts/install.ps1 | iex; Install-Gitmap -Version "v2.51.0" -InstallDir "D:\DevTools\gitmap"
```

**Custom directory install (downloaded script):**

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -InstallDir "D:\DevTools\gitmap"
```

**Pinned version + custom directory (downloaded script):**

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -Version v2.51.0 -InstallDir "C:\tools\gitmap"
```

**Linux / macOS — specific version:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/main/gitmap/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- --version v2.51.0
```

> **Tip:** Use `gitmap list-versions` to see all available release versions before pinning.

### Clone & Setup (Development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7.git gitmap
```

```bash
cd gitmap
./setup.sh
```

The setup script installs the pre-commit hook (golangci-lint), verifies your Go toolchain, and downloads dependencies. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full development workflow.

### Update Source Before Building (avoid the `fileExists redeclared` regression)

If you have an existing local checkout, **always pull the latest source before
building**. Three releases (v3.92.0, v3.113.0, v3.114.0) eliminated a
`fileExists` symbol collision in `gitmap/cmd/`. A pre-v3.92.0 checkout
will fail to compile with:

```
cmd/updaterepo.go:118:6: fileExists redeclared in this block
        cmd/updatedebugwindows.go:148:6: other declaration of fileExists
```

This error is **always** a stale-checkout symptom — the current source
cannot produce it. Run the canonical update sequence:

```bash
cd /path/to/gitmap
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git status                          # must report "working tree clean"
git log -1 --format='%H %s'         # capture the SHA you're about to build
```

#### Verify the v3.92.0+ rename fix is present

Three quick checks confirm the redeclaration fix is in your tree. All
three must pass before you run `./run.sh` / `./run.ps1`:

**1. The declared version is v3.92.0 or newer:**

```bash
grep '^const Version = ' gitmap/constants/constants.go
# expected: const Version = "3.115.0"   (or higher)
```

**2. `gitmap/cmd/updatedebugwindows.go` does NOT declare a local helper:**

```bash
grep -nE '^func (fileExists|fileExistsLoose)\(' gitmap/cmd/updatedebugwindows.go
# expected: (no output — the helper moved to gitmap/fsutil in v3.113.0)
```

**3. The shared `fsutil` package exists and is imported by `cmd/`:**

```bash
test -f gitmap/fsutil/exists.go && echo "fsutil package present"
grep -l 'gitmap/fsutil' gitmap/cmd/updaterepo.go gitmap/cmd/updatedebugwindows.go
# expected: both file paths printed
```

If any check fails, your checkout is older than v3.113.0. Re-run the
update sequence above; if it still fails, your branch diverged before
the fix landed and needs `git rebase origin/main`.

#### Run the pre-build provenance stamp (recommended)

Since v3.115.0, `./run.sh` and `./run.ps1` automatically print a
provenance stamp before invoking `go build`:

```bash
bash scripts/build-stamp.sh           # prints SHA, version, file fingerprints
bash scripts/build-stamp.sh --strict  # exits 1 if a redeclaration risk is detected
```

A healthy stamp ends with:

```
guards
  redecl-risk-check       ok (no local fileExists* in cmd/ — fsutil migration present)
```

If you see `FAIL — fileExists/fileExistsLoose declared in both files`,
**stop and re-pull** — `go build` will fail with the redeclaration
error. The Windows equivalent is `pwsh scripts/build-stamp.ps1 -Strict`.

### Install-script behavior spec (shareable with any AI)

The canonical, repository-agnostic contract that every installer in this
project (and any sibling repo) MUST follow lives at:

> **[`spec/07-generic-release/09-generic-install-script-behavior.md`](spec/07-generic-release/09-generic-install-script-behavior.md)**

It defines the two install modes in one place:

- **Strict tag mode** — explicit `--version <tag>` installs that exact
  release with **no** fallback to `latest`, no `-v<N+i>` sibling probe,
  and no main-branch fallback. Missing tag → exit 1 with a canonical
  message.
- **Discovery mode** — no tag supplied → probe the next 20 `-v<N+i>`
  sibling repos in **parallel** (max-hit wins) → fall back to
  `releases/latest` → fall back to the default branch HEAD as a last
  resort.

The spec is intentionally generic (placeholders for `<owner>`, `<stem>`,
`<binary>`, `<installerPath>`) so you can hand it to any AI working on
any repository's installer and they will implement the same contract.

## What It Does

A portable CLI that scans directory trees for Git repositories, extracts clone URLs and branch info, and outputs structured data. Every scan produces **all outputs** automatically:

- **Terminal** — formatted table to stdout
- **CSV** — `gitmap.csv`
- **JSON** — `gitmap.json`
- **Folder Structure** — `folder-structure.md` (tree view of discovered repos)

All files are written to `.gitmap/output/` at the root of the scanned directory.

## Command Reference

<div align="center">

### Scanning & Discovery

</div>

| Command | Alias | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `scan` | `s` | Scan directory for Git repos |
| `rescan` | `rsc` | Re-scan previously scanned directories |
| `list` | `ls` | Show all tracked repos with slugs |

```bash
gitmap scan ~/projects --output json --mode ssh
gitmap ls go                    # list Go projects
gitmap rescan                   # re-scan all known directories
```

→ [scan](gitmap/helptext/scan.md) · [rescan](gitmap/helptext/rescan.md) · [list](gitmap/helptext/list.md)

#### Scan rules — what counts as a repo, and how deep we walk

The scanner is intentionally strict so the catalog stays trustworthy.
These rules are stable across releases and are enforced by
[`gitmap/scanner/scanner.go`](gitmap/scanner/scanner.go) (see also
[`spec/01-app/03-scanner.md`](spec/01-app/03-scanner.md)).

**1. Repo markers — what makes a directory a "repo".** A directory is
recorded as a repo when it contains a child entry literally named
`.git` matching either of these forms:

| Marker form | Matches | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `.git/` directory | Standard `git init` / `git clone` checkout | Counted unconditionally. |
| `.git` regular file | `git worktree add` linked checkouts; submodules whose `.git` was absorbed into the superproject | Only counted when the file's contents start with the literal prefix `gitdir:` (read budget: 256 bytes). A stray `.git` text file without that prefix is ignored to prevent false positives. |

Anything else under the directory — bare repos, `*.git` mirror folders,
hand-rolled `HEAD` files — is **not** treated as a repo by `gitmap scan`.

**2. Gitdir / worktree handling — no descent into discovered repos.**
Once a directory is recorded as a repo (by either marker form above),
the scanner does **not** descend into its subtree. This means:

- A worktree's `.git` file (`gitdir: /path/to/main/.git/worktrees/<name>`)
  registers the worktree directory itself as a repo. The linked main
  repo is recorded separately when its own `.git/` directory is reached
  via the normal walk.
- Submodules with absorbed `.git` files are recorded as repos at their
  own location, independent of the superproject.
- Nested repos hidden under a discovered repo (e.g. a `vendor/` checkout
  under a project that itself is a repo) are **not** discovered. Move
  them outside, scan them separately, or scan their parent directly.

**3. Default 4-level nesting cap.** The scanner refuses to descend more
than `DefaultMaxDepth = 4` directory levels below the scan root, even
when no `.git` marker has been found on the path. Depth is counted
from the root:

| Depth | Example path under `gitmap scan ~/code` |
|---|---|
| `0` | `~/code` (the scan root itself) |
| `1` | `~/code/<org>` |
| `2` | `~/code/<org>/<project>` |
| `3` | `~/code/<org>/<project>/<service>` |
| `4` | `~/code/<org>/<project>/<service>/<module>` |
| `5+` | **Not walked** under the default cap |

The cap exists to prevent runaway walks into dependency trees that
slipped past the exclude list (e.g. a forgotten `node_modules/` deep
inside a project). Repos discovered at any depth still stop their own
subtree from descending — the cap only matters for paths that have
**not** hit a `.git` marker yet.

Override via `ScanOptions.MaxDepth` when calling the library directly:
a positive value sets a custom cap, a negative value disables the cap
entirely (legacy unbounded behavior), and zero (the field's zero
value) keeps `DefaultMaxDepth = 4`.

**Excluded directory names** are skipped before the depth check fires
— see the per-scan `--config` exclude list and the project defaults
documented in [`gitmap/helptext/scan.md`](gitmap/helptext/scan.md).

#### Scan examples — markers, worktrees, and the depth cap in action

The three scenarios below show the rules above as concrete commands
and the rows you would (or would not) see. CSV output is shown
because v3.150.0 added a trailing `depth` column that makes the
4-level cap auditable at a glance.

**Example A — marker detection (`.git/` dir vs `.git` worktree file vs stray text file).**

Layout:

```text
~/code/
├── alpha/         .git/                     ← standard checkout
├── beta/          .git  (file: "gitdir: …") ← worktree-style marker
└── gamma/         .git  (file: "hello")     ← stray text, NOT a repo
```

```bash
gitmap scan ~/code --output csv
```

```csv
repoName,httpsUrl,sshUrl,branch,branchSource,relativePath,absolutePath,cloneInstruction,notes,depth
alpha,…,…,main,remote-head,alpha,/home/u/code/alpha,git clone …,,1
beta,…,…,main,remote-head,beta,/home/u/code/beta,git clone …,,1
```

`gamma/` is silently dropped: its `.git` file lacks the `gitdir:`
prefix, so rule 1 rejects it. Only the two valid markers produce
rows, both at depth 1 (immediate children of the scan root).

**Example B — worktrees and absorbed submodules don't double-count and don't hide siblings.**

Layout:

```text
~/work/
├── main-repo/                       .git/      ← superproject
│   ├── vendor/lib/                  .git/      ← nested repo: HIDDEN by rule 2
│   └── modules/auth/                .git file  ← absorbed submodule
└── main-repo-feature-x/             .git file  ← `git worktree add` checkout
```

```bash
gitmap scan ~/work --output csv
```

```csv
repoName,httpsUrl,sshUrl,branch,branchSource,relativePath,absolutePath,cloneInstruction,notes,depth
main-repo,…,…,main,remote-head,main-repo,/home/u/work/main-repo,git clone …,,1
main-repo-feature-x,…,…,feature-x,head,main-repo-feature-x,/home/u/work/main-repo-feature-x,git clone …,,1
```

The worktree checkout is its own row (rule 1, gitdir-prefixed file).
The absorbed submodule under `main-repo/modules/auth` and the
`vendor/lib` checkout are **both hidden** because rule 2 stops descent
the moment `main-repo/.git/` is recorded. To catalog them, scan
`~/work/main-repo/modules/` or `~/work/main-repo/vendor/` directly.

**Example C — what the default 4-level cap skips.**

Layout (depths annotated):

```text
~/mono/                                                       depth 0
├── team-a/                                                   depth 1
│   └── service-x/                          .git/             depth 2  ← FOUND
├── team-b/proj/svc/mod/                    .git/             depth 4  ← FOUND (at cap)
└── team-c/area/group/proj/svc/             .git/             depth 5  ← SKIPPED
```

```bash
gitmap scan ~/mono --output csv
```

```csv
repoName,httpsUrl,sshUrl,branch,branchSource,relativePath,absolutePath,cloneInstruction,notes,depth
service-x,…,…,main,remote-head,team-a/service-x,/home/u/mono/team-a/service-x,git clone …,,2
mod,…,…,main,remote-head,team-b/proj/svc/mod,/home/u/mono/team-b/proj/svc/mod,git clone …,,4
```

The depth-5 repo under `team-c/` is **not** in the output: the walker
read `team-c/area/group/proj/svc/` (depth 4) and saw no `.git` marker
on the path, so it refused to enqueue depth-5 children. To catch it,
either scan deeper into the subtree:

```bash
gitmap scan ~/mono/team-c --output csv      # new root → depth resets to 0
```

…or override the cap globally (positive = custom, negative =
unbounded):

```bash
# library callers only — set ScanOptions.MaxDepth = -1 for legacy
# unbounded walks; this is intentionally not a CLI flag so casual
# `gitmap scan` stays fast and bounded by default.
```

A `depth` value equal to the cap (`4` under defaults) in your CSV is
the diagnostic signal: those rows sit on the boundary and are the
candidates to investigate when something seems missing.

#### `rescan` and the depth cap — what survives, what disappears, what's newly found

`gitmap rescan` is **not** an incremental diff against the database.
It reads the cached `last-scan.json` and replays the original
`gitmap scan` command verbatim — same root, same `--config`, same
`--mode`, and the same `DefaultMaxDepth = 4`. The output is whatever
a fresh walk produces today, period. Concretely:

| Repo state at rescan time | Was previously discovered? | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Still at depth ≤ 4 with a valid `.git` marker | yes | Re-emitted, same row, possibly with refreshed branch / clone-instruction. |
| Still at depth ≤ 4, but its `.git` marker is gone (deleted, broken worktree) | yes | **Dropped from the new output**. The DB row is reconciled away on the next scan-cycle commit — `rescan` does not "remember" it just because it was there last time. |
| Moved deeper than depth 4 since the last scan | yes | **Silently disappears** from the rescan output. The cap fires before the marker is reached; the previous discovery grants no special exemption. |
| Newly added at depth ≤ 4 (e.g. a fresh `git worktree add` checkout placed beside the superproject) | no | **Picked up** as a new row, depth filled in from the walker. Worktree-style `.git` files are recognized via the `gitdir:` prefix exactly as on the first scan (rule 1). |
| Newly added worktree **inside** a discovered repo's subtree | no | **Not picked up.** Rule 2 (no descent into a discovered repo) still wins — the worktree lives under the superproject's stopped subtree. Move it outside, or scan its parent directly. |
| Newly added at depth ≥ 5 | no | **Not picked up** for the same reason fresh `scan` would miss it: the cap fires before depth 5 is enqueued. |

The takeaway: `rescan` is a *replay*, not a *delta*. To widen what it
sees, edit the cached scan parameters (re-run `gitmap scan <root>`
with a different `--config` or a shallower starting root, which
overwrites `last-scan.json`). The library-level `ScanOptions.MaxDepth`
override applies to both `scan` and `rescan` since they share the
same walker — set it negative for unbounded walks when you really
need to catch a depth-5+ repo without restructuring directories.

### Scan & Clone — `--config`, `--mode`, `--output` recipes

</div>

Concrete, copy-pasteable examples for the three flags you'll reach for most.
Defaults are `--config ./data/config.json`, `--mode https`, and
`--output terminal`. Source of truth: [`gitmap/helptext/scan.md`](gitmap/helptext/scan.md)
and [`gitmap/helptext/clone.md`](gitmap/helptext/clone.md).

#### `--config <path>` — point scan at a non-default config

```bash
# default: reads ./data/config.json relative to the binary
gitmap scan ~/projects

# point at a project-local config (commit it alongside your repo list)
gitmap scan ~/projects --config ./gitmap.config.json

# CI: point at a profile that excludes vendored & node_modules trees
gitmap scan /workspace --config /etc/gitmap/ci-profile.json --quiet

# different config for a different drive on Windows
gitmap scan D:\wp-work --config D:\gitmap\configs\wp.json
```

The `--config` path is recorded in the scan cache, so a follow-up
`gitmap rescan` replays the exact same config without re-typing it.

> 📖 **Full key reference:** every JSON key gitmap reads from `data/config.json`
> — defaults, allowed values, and the nested `release` shape — is documented
> in [`docs/config-schema.md`](docs/config-schema.md).

#### `--mode ssh|https` — pick the clone-URL flavor recorded in output

```bash
# HTTPS (default) — works without keys, prompts for token on private repos
gitmap scan ~/projects --mode https
# → records: https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git

# SSH — uses your ~/.ssh keys, no token prompt, works for private repos
gitmap scan ~/projects --mode ssh
# → records: git@github.com:<owner>/<repo>.git

# scan once in HTTPS, then re-scan in SSH for a CI machine that has keys
gitmap scan ~/projects --mode https --output json --output-path ./out/https
gitmap scan ~/projects --mode ssh   --output json --output-path ./out/ssh
```

The mode only affects the **URL string written to the output files** —
your local working copies are not touched. Downstream `gitmap clone`
honours whichever URL the file contains, so the choice flows end-to-end.

#### `--output csv|json|terminal` — pick the artifact format

```bash
# terminal (default) — pretty-print to stdout, no files written
gitmap scan ~/projects

# csv — machine-readable spreadsheet (one row per repo)
gitmap scan ~/projects --output csv
# → writes ./.gitmap/output/gitmap.csv

# json — full structured payload (branch, remote, tags, last-commit SHA, ...)
gitmap scan ~/projects --output json
# → writes ./.gitmap/output/gitmap.json

# custom output directory (handy in CI artifact uploads)
gitmap scan ~/projects --output json --output-path ./build/scan-results
```

#### Combined recipes (the patterns you'll actually use)

```bash
# 1. Daily local sync: HTTPS + JSON, cached config
gitmap scan ~/projects --config ~/.gitmap/personal.json --mode https --output json

# 2. CI snapshot for SSH-keyed runners: SSH + CSV
gitmap scan /workspace --config /etc/gitmap/ci.json --mode ssh --output csv

# 3. Quick one-off sanity check (no files, no config tweaks)
gitmap scan . --output terminal

# 4. Scan once, then bulk-clone elsewhere using the SSH JSON manifest
gitmap scan ~/projects --mode ssh --output json --output-path ./manifest
gitmap clone ./manifest/gitmap.json --target-dir /opt/restored --safe-pull

# 5. CSV → another machine → clone everything via HTTPS
gitmap scan ~/projects --mode https --output csv --output-path ./share
# (copy ./share/gitmap.csv to the other host, then:)
gitmap clone ./gitmap.csv --target-dir ~/work --github-desktop
```

`gitmap clone` automatically picks the right input parser from the file
extension (`.json` / `.csv` / `.txt`) or the shorthand keywords `json` /
`csv` / `text`, so the `--output` format you chose at scan time is the
format `clone` will read on the other side.

### Move & Merge

</div>

| Command | Alias | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `mv` | `move` | Move LEFT into RIGHT, then delete LEFT |
| `merge-both` | — | Fill missing files on BOTH sides; prompt on conflicts |
| `merge-left` | — | Copy from RIGHT into LEFT; prompt on conflicts |
| `merge-right` | — | Copy from LEFT into RIGHT; prompt on conflicts |

Each side (LEFT / RIGHT) can be a local folder OR a remote URL.
URL endpoints are auto-cloned (or pulled if already cloned), and
the result is committed + pushed back when the operation completes.

```bash
# move: classic file copy + delete source
gitmap mv ./gitmap-v7 ./gitmap-v7
gitmap mv ./gitmap-v7 https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7
gitmap mv https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7 ./another-folder
gitmap mv https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7 \
         https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7

# merge-both: bidirectional fill (each side gains what the other has)
gitmap merge-both ./gitmap-v7 ./gitmap-v7
gitmap merge-both ./gitmap-v7 https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7
gitmap merge-both https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7 \
                  https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7

# merge-left: take RIGHT into LEFT
gitmap merge-left ./gitmap-v7 ./gitmap-v7
gitmap merge-left ./local https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7

# merge-right: take LEFT into RIGHT
gitmap merge-right ./gitmap-v7 ./gitmap-v7
gitmap merge-right ./local https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7

# bypass conflict prompts: source-side wins by default
gitmap merge-right ./gitmap-v7 ./gitmap-v7 -y
gitmap merge-both  ./gitmap-v7 ./gitmap-v7 -y --prefer-newer

# pin remote branch + preview
gitmap merge-right ./local https://github.com/owner/repo:develop
gitmap mv ./gitmap-v7 ./gitmap-v7 --dry-run
```

Conflict prompt keys: **L**eft / **R**ight / **S**kip /
**A**ll-left / **B**all-right / **Q**uit. Pass `-y` (or `-a`) to
bypass; combine with `--prefer-left` / `--prefer-right` /
`--prefer-newer` / `--prefer-skip` to override the default policy.

## 🚀 gitmap Release

**Current version:** `v3.50.0` · Cross-platform (Windows · Linux · macOS) · Single static binary

</div>

The `gitmap release` command turns a clean working tree into a versioned,
tagged, multi-target GitHub release in one step — branch + tag + push +
binary build + checksum + changelog body + GitHub Release page.

### Install or upgrade gitmap

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/main/gitmap/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

#### Linux / macOS

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/main/gitmap/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

#### Pin to an exact version

```powershell
# Windows — install v3.50.0 exactly, skip the "latest" lookup
$ver = 'v3.50.0'
$installer = irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/main/gitmap/scripts/install.ps1
& ([scriptblock]::Create($installer)) -Version $ver -NoDiscovery
```

```bash
# Linux / macOS — install v3.50.0 exactly
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/main/gitmap/scripts/install.sh \
  | bash -s -- --version v3.50.0 --no-discovery
```

Verify:

```bash
gitmap --version
# gitmap v3.50.0
```

### Release CLI examples

| Goal | Command |
|------|---------|
| Auto-bump minor (`3.50.0 → 3.51.0`) and release | `gitmap r` |
| Bump patch and release | `gitmap release --bump patch` |
| Bump minor with binary + zip + checksums | `gitmap release --bump minor --bin --compress --checksums` |
| Release a specific version with notes | `gitmap release v3.51.0 -N "Performance pass"` |
| Release any registered repo from anywhere | `gitmap ra my-api v1.4.0` |
| Pull, then release a registered repo | `gitmap rap my-api v1.4.0` |
| Release gitmap itself from any directory | `gitmap release-self --bump patch` |
| Multi-repo: bump every repo under cwd | `gitmap r -y` (run from a folder of repos) |
| Preview without pushing | `gitmap release --bump patch --dry-run` |
| List build targets that will be produced | `gitmap release --list-targets` |

```bash
# End-to-end: register once, release from anywhere
cd ~/code/my-api
gitmap as my-api                  # one-time alias
cd ~                              # go anywhere
gitmap ra my-api v1.4.0 --pull    # pull --ff-only, release, push, build, attach
```

> **Auto-stash safety:** dirty trees are stashed before `release-alias`
> with a label like `my-api-1.4.0-1715000000` and popped on exit. Pass
> `--no-stash` to abort instead, or `--dry-run` to preview every step.

### What you get — output formats

Every successful release produces all of the following:

| Artifact | Where | Format |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Release branch | local + `origin` | `release/v3.51.0` |
| Annotated tag | local + `origin` | `v3.51.0` |
| Local manifest | `.gitmap/release/latest.json` | JSON (version, tag, branch) |
| GitHub Release page | github.com/&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/releases | Title + body + assets |
| Release body | GitHub Release page | Markdown — CHANGELOG section + pinned-install snippet |
| Cross-compiled binaries (with `--bin`) | uploaded as release assets | `gitmap_v3.51.0_<os>_<arch>[.exe]` for 6 targets |
| Compressed archives (with `--compress`) | uploaded as release assets | `.zip` (Windows) / `.tar.gz` (Linux/macOS) |
| Checksums (with `--checksums`) | uploaded as release asset | `SHA256SUMS.txt` |
| Custom zip groups (with `--zip-group`) | uploaded as release assets | `.zip` bundles per group |

**Default build targets** (override with `--targets` or `release.targets` in `config.json`):

```
linux/amd64    linux/arm64
darwin/amd64   darwin/arm64
windows/amd64  windows/arm64
```

**Sample terminal output:**

```
  Creating release v3.51.0...
  ✓ Created branch release/v3.51.0
  ✓ Created tag v3.51.0
  ✓ Pushed branch and tag to origin
  ✓ Release metadata written to .gitmap/release/latest.json
  ✓ Committed release metadata on release/v3.51.0
  ✓ Marked v3.51.0 as latest release
  ✓ Using CHANGELOG.md as release body
  ✓ Attached gitmap_v3.51.0_windows_amd64.exe
  ✓ Attached gitmap_v3.51.0_linux_amd64
  ✓ Attached SHA256SUMS.txt

  ── Release v3.51.0 complete ──
```

### Configuration file

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Default path** | `./data/config.json` (resolved relative to the gitmap binary) |
| **Override** | Edit the file directly — there is no `--config` flag; CLI flags always win over config values |
| **Format** | JSON, loaded once per command via `config.LoadFromFile` |
| **Missing file** | Silently falls back to built-in defaults (no error) |

**Full schema** (every field is optional; omit a field to use its default):

```json
{
  "defaultMode":      "https",
  "defaultOutput":    "terminal",
  "outputDir":        "./output",
  "excludeDirs":      ["node_modules", ".git"],
  "notes":            "",
  "dashboardRefresh": 30,
  "release": {
    "targets": [
      { "goos": "windows", "goarch": "amd64" },
      { "goos": "linux",   "goarch": "amd64" },
      { "goos": "darwin",  "goarch": "arm64" }
    ],
    "checksums": true,
    "compress":  true
  }
}
```

**Field meanings (release-relevant only):**

| Field | Type | Default | Effect |
|-------|------|---------|--------|
| `release.targets[]` | array of `{goos, goarch}` | built-in 6-target matrix | Cross-compile matrix used when `--bin` is set. `--targets` flag overrides this entirely. |
| `release.targets[].goos` | string | — | Go `GOOS` value: `windows`, `linux`, `darwin`, `freebsd`, … |
| `release.targets[].goarch` | string | — | Go `GOARCH` value: `amd64`, `arm64`, `386`, … |
| `release.checksums` | bool | `false` | Always emit `SHA256SUMS.txt`. Equivalent to passing `--checksums` on every release. |
| `release.compress` | bool | `false` | Always wrap assets in `.zip`/`.tar.gz`. Equivalent to passing `--compress` on every release. |
| `outputDir` | string | `./output` | Where non-release CLI exports land (scan reports, etc). Not used by `release` directly. |
| `excludeDirs` | array | `[]` | Folders to skip during scanning. Not used by `release` directly. |

**Resolution order** (last writer wins):

```
built-in defaults  <  data/config.json  <  CLI flags
```

So `release.compress: false` in config + `--compress` on the CLI → compression ON for that one run.

### CLI flag reference — `gitmap release` / `r`

```
gitmap release [version] [flags]
gitmap r       [version] [flags]
```

`version` is positional and optional. Forms accepted:

- `v3.51.0` — release exactly this tag
- *(omitted)* — auto-bump **minor** from the last release in `.gitmap/release/latest.json`, with a `[y/N]` prompt (skip with `-y`)
- combined with `--bump` is an error (mutually exclusive)

| Flag | Type | Default | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| `--bump <level>` | string | (none) | Auto-increment version segment. Accepts `major`, `minor`, or `patch`. Mutually exclusive with positional `version`. |
| `-N`, `--notes <text>` | string | git commit subject | Release title / notes used as the GitHub Release body header. |
| `--commit <sha>` | string | `HEAD` | Create the release from a specific commit instead of `HEAD`. Mutually exclusive with `--branch`. |
| `--branch <name>` | string | current branch | Create the release from the latest commit of `<name>`. Mutually exclusive with `--commit`. |
| `--assets <path>` | string | (none) | Single file or directory to attach as release assets (in addition to `--bin`, `-Z`, `--zip-group`). |
| `-b`, `--bin` | bool | `false` | Cross-compile Go binaries for every target in the matrix and attach them as release assets. |
| `--targets <list>` | string | from config / built-ins | Comma-separated `goos/goarch` pairs (e.g. `windows/amd64,linux/arm64`). Overrides `release.targets` in config. |
| `--list-targets` | bool | `false` | Resolve the target matrix, print it, exit 0. No release is created. Useful for verifying config. |
| `--compress` | bool | `false` (or config) | Wrap each binary in a per-target archive: `.zip` for Windows, `.tar.gz` for Linux/macOS. |
| `--checksums` | bool | `false` (or config) | Emit `SHA256SUMS.txt` covering every uploaded asset and attach it to the release. |
| `-Z <path>` | repeatable | (none) | Ad-hoc zip: include a single file or folder as a release asset. May be passed multiple times. |
| `--zip-group <name>` | repeatable | (none) | Attach a persistent named **zip group** (defined via `gitmap zg add`) as a release asset. May be passed multiple times. |
| `--bundle <name>` | string | (none) | Combine all `-Z` items into one archive named `<name>.zip` instead of one archive per item. |
| `--draft` | bool | `false` | Create the GitHub Release as an unpublished draft. Branch/tag are still pushed. |
| `--dry-run` | bool | `false` | Print every step that would run (branch, tag, push, upload) without touching git or GitHub. |
| `--no-commit` | bool | `false` | Skip the post-release auto-commit + push of `.gitmap/release/latest.json`. |
| `-y`, `--yes` | bool | `false` | Auto-confirm every prompt: bare-release auto-bump, multi-repo scan, orphaned-metadata cleanup. |
| `--verbose` | bool | `false` | Write detailed stdout/stderr trace to a timestamped log file under `data/logs/`. |

**Mutually exclusive combinations** (gitmap will exit with an error):

| Combination | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| `<version>` **and** `--bump` | Either explicit or auto-bump — pick one. |
| `--commit` **and** `--branch` | A release has exactly one source commit. |

### Changelog (recent versions)

Concise, grouped per version. Each entry calls out **💥 Breaking**, **✨ Enhancements**, and **🐛 Fixes**. Versions with nothing in a category omit it. Full history lives in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md); query it from the CLI with `gitmap changelog vX.Y.Z` or `gitmap cl --limit 5`.

#### v3.52.0 — 2026-04-21 — CI lint baseline cache controls (docs)

- ✨ **Enhancements:** `spec/09-pipeline/01-ci-pipeline.md` now documents the two `workflow_dispatch` inputs (`lint_baseline_cache_version`, `lint_baseline_disable`) that let operators rotate or bypass the golangci-lint baseline cache without editing the workflow. Includes copy-paste `gh workflow run` examples and a new "Job: Lint Baseline Diff" section covering cache keys, seeding mode, and sticky PR comment behavior.
- 🐛 **Fixes:** none — documentation-only sync; no CI behavior change.

#### v3.51.0 — 2026-04-21 — `cn v+1 -f` flag parsing + cleaner release trailer

- ✨ **Enhancements:**
  - Three-stage progress layout (Prepare → Clone → Finalize) now shown when `gitmap cn -f` is used; default `cn` output is unchanged.
  - `MsgForceReleasing` rewritten to plainly describe the Windows file-lock release ("Stepping out of … to release the file lock").
- 🐛 **Fixes:**
  - `gitmap cn v+1 -f` no longer silently dropped the `-f` flag when it followed a positional version arg. Fixed via `reorderFlagsBeforeArgs(args)` in `gitmap/cmd/clonenextflags.go` and an updated value-flag map in `gitmap/cmd/releaseargs.go` (covers `--csv`, `--ssh-key`, `-K`, `--target-dir`).
  - `Force` now implies `Keep` for the prior-folder cleanup, suppressing the redundant "Remove current folder?" prompt.
  - `MsgInstallHintUnix` gained a trailing blank line so the post-release shell prompt no longer sits flush against the `curl … | sh` line.

#### v3.50.0 — 2026-04-21 — Force-flatten for `clone-next`

- 💥 **Breaking:** none. New flag is opt-in and defaults to existing behavior.
- ✨ **Enhancements:**
  - `gitmap cn -f` / `--force`: force a flat clone even when cwd IS the target folder. Chdirs to the parent before remove (releases the Windows file lock), then re-clones into `<base>/`.
  - Refuses the silent versioned-folder fallback under `-f` — you get a flat layout or a clear error, never a surprise rename.
  - `--force` / `-f` added to zsh + PowerShell completions and to `clone-next` help text.
- 🐛 **Fixes:** `MsgFlattenLockedHint` now mentions `-f` so users discover the escape hatch on the first lock warning.

#### v3.32.1 — 2026-04-20 — `gitmap status` legacy path fix

- 🐛 **Fixes:** `status` no longer fails with `could not load gitmap.json at output\gitmap.json`. It now reads from the unified `.gitmap/output/` path and transparently falls through to the SQLite database when the JSON file is missing.

#### v3.32.0 — 2026-04-20 — Scan output: hoisted base path

- ✨ **Enhancements:** `gitmap scan` post-scan summary prints `📂 Base: <path>` once and lists each artifact by filename only. All icon/label columns aligned to a 12-char gutter.

#### v3.31.0 — 2026-04-20 — Cross-dir release/clone-next + `has-change`

- ✨ **Enhancements:**
  - `gitmap r <repo> <vX.Y.Z>` and `gitmap cn <repo> <vX.Y.Z>` — run from anywhere; gitmap chdirs in, fetches/pulls (rebase), auto-stashes, releases, then chdirs back and pops. Single-arg forms unchanged.
  - New `gitmap has-change` (`hc`) command: prints `true`/`false` per dimension (`dirty`/`ahead`/`behind`) or `--all` for all three; `--fetch=false` for offline use.
- 🐛 **Fixes:** `gitmap ssh` no longer exits 1 when `~/.ssh/id_rsa` already exists outside gitmap's DB — disk check moved before DB check; `--force` backs up to `id_rsa.bak.<unix-ts>` first.

#### v3.30.0 — 2026-04-20 — Go Report Card badge URL

- 🐛 **Fixes:** README badge now points at `goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/gitmap` (real module path) instead of the repo root, which 404'd because there is no `go.mod` at the root.

#### v3.28.0 — 2026-04-20 — Lucrative scan summary

- ✨ **Enhancements:** `gitmap scan` summary regrouped into three labeled sections (`📦 Output Artifacts`, `🗄️ Database`, post-scan log) with category icons per row.

#### v3.27.0 — 2026-04-20 — Real Go module path

- 💥 **Breaking:** `go.mod` module path renamed from a placeholder to `github.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v7/gitmap`. Anyone importing the module by the old path must update their import lines. CLI users are unaffected.

#### v3.26.0 — 2026-04-20 — Constants collision audit + CI guard

- ✨ **Enhancements:** new CI guard rejects PRs that introduce duplicate `Cmd*` / `Msg*` / `Err*` identifiers across `gitmap/constants/`. Backfilled audit caught 0 collisions on `main`.

#### v3.25.0 — 2026-04-20 — `github-desktop` (`gd`) command

- ✨ **Enhancements:** `gitmap gd` registers cwd repo with GitHub Desktop without running a full `scan` first. Pairs well with `clone-next`.

#### v3.24.0 — 2026-04-20 — Quiet release output

- 🐛 **Fixes:** suppressed cosmetic `LF will be replaced by CRLF` warnings during the release pipeline (kept underlying behavior identical; only stderr noise is muted).

#### v3.22.0 — 2026-04-20 — Auto-register on release

- ✨ **Enhancements:** `gitmap r` auto-registers the cwd repo in the database if it isn't tracked yet, instead of failing with "repo not found". The new repo is tagged with the current scan folder.

> Versions older than v3.22 are summarized in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). Notable jumps: **v3.21** (schema-version fast path + `db-migrate --force`), **v3.19** (bare release auto-bumps **minor** + multi-repo scan-dir release), **v3.17** (`Release.RepoId` foreign key + doctor duplicate-binary check), **v3.16** (repo renamed to `gitmap-v7`).

### Copy-paste workflows — scan, output, re-clone

End-to-end recipes for the data pipeline that feeds a release: discover repos with `scan`, capture the result as CSV/JSON, and rebuild the same set on another machine with `clone`. Every block below is a single copy-paste — no placeholders to edit unless wrapped in `<…>`.

#### Scan with HTTPS clone URLs (default)

```bash
# Scan the current directory tree, terminal output only
gitmap scan

# Scan a specific folder
gitmap scan D:\wp-work

# Quiet mode (skip the post-scan clone-help section)
gitmap scan D:\wp-work --quiet
```

#### Scan with SSH clone URLs

```bash
# SSH-style URLs (git@github.com:owner/repo.git) instead of HTTPS
gitmap scan D:\wp-work --mode ssh

# SSH + auto-register every repo with GitHub Desktop
gitmap scan D:\wp-work --mode ssh --github-desktop
```

#### Output to CSV

```bash
# Write CSV to the default location: ./.gitmap/output/gitmap.csv
gitmap scan D:\wp-work --output csv

# CSV + custom output directory
gitmap scan D:\wp-work --output csv --output-path ./reports

# CSV + SSH URLs in one go
gitmap scan D:\wp-work --output csv --mode ssh --output-path ./reports
```

#### Output to JSON

```bash
# Write JSON to the default location: ./.gitmap/output/gitmap.json
gitmap scan D:\wp-work --output json

# JSON + custom directory + open the folder when done
gitmap scan D:\wp-work --output json --output-path ./reports --open

# JSON + SSH URLs (handy for piping into another tool)
gitmap scan D:\wp-work --output json --mode ssh
```

> Every `gitmap scan` run **also** writes the standard artifact bundle to `./.gitmap/output/` regardless of `--output`: `gitmap.csv`, `gitmap.json`, `gitmap.txt`, `folder-structure.md`, `clone.ps1`, `direct-clone.ps1`, `direct-clone-ssh.ps1`, `register-desktop.ps1`, `last-scan.json`. The `--output` flag controls the **terminal** representation only.

#### Re-clone everything from a scan file

```bash
# Re-clone from the JSON file produced by a previous scan
gitmap clone ./.gitmap/output/gitmap.json

# Re-clone from CSV
gitmap clone ./.gitmap/output/gitmap.csv

# Re-clone from a plain text list
gitmap clone ./.gitmap/output/gitmap.txt

# Re-clone into a specific base directory
gitmap clone ./.gitmap/output/gitmap.json --target-dir D:\restored

# Re-clone + safe pull on existing repos (retries + diagnostics)
gitmap clone ./.gitmap/output/gitmap.json --target-dir D:\restored --safe-pull

# Re-clone + auto-register everything with GitHub Desktop (no prompt)
gitmap clone ./.gitmap/output/gitmap.json --target-dir D:\restored --github-desktop
```

#### One-shot single repo (no scan file needed)

```bash
# Clone a single URL — versioned URLs (e.g. -v13) auto-flatten to <base>/
gitmap clone https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/wp-onboarding-v13.git

# Clone into a custom folder name (skips auto-flatten)
gitmap clone https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/wp-onboarding-v13.git my-onboarding

# Clone via SSH
gitmap clone git@github.com:alimtvnetwork/wp-onboarding-v13.git
```

#### Full backup-and-restore round-trip

```bash
# === On the source machine ===
gitmap scan D:\wp-work --mode ssh --output json
# → produces D:\wp-work\.gitmap\output\gitmap.json (+ all sibling artifacts)

# Copy the file to the new machine, then:

# === On the target machine ===
gitmap clone gitmap.json --target-dir D:\wp-work --github-desktop --safe-pull
# → re-clones every repo via SSH, registers each with GitHub Desktop,
#   and pulls if any of them already exist on disk.
```

## Build & Deploy

### Makefile Targets

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make all` | Lint → Test → Build (default) |
| `make setup` | Install hooks and dev tools |
| `make lint` | Run golangci-lint |
| `make test` | Run all tests |
| `make build` | Compile for current platform |
| `make vulncheck` | Scan dependencies for CVEs |
| `make release BUMP=patch` | Lint, test, then release |
| `make release-dry` | Preview release without executing |
| `make clean` | Remove build artifacts |

### Build from Source

```bash
cd gitmap && go build -o ../gitmap .
```

### Build via run.ps1 (Windows)

```powershell
.\run.ps1                        # Full pipeline: pull, build, deploy, setup
.\run.ps1 -R scan                # Build + scan parent folder
.\run.ps1 -R scan D:\repos --mode ssh
.\run.ps1 -uninstall             # Run uninstall-quick.ps1 -Yes and exit
.\run.ps1 -reinstall             # Uninstall, then re-run run.ps1 with no args
.\run.ps1 -NoSetup               # Skip the auto `gitmap setup` after deploy
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-NoPull` | Skip `git pull` |
| `-NoDeploy` | Skip deploy step |
| `-NoSetup` | Skip auto-running `gitmap setup` after deploy |
| `-Update` | Update mode with post-update validation |
| `-uninstall` | Run `uninstall-quick.ps1 -Yes` and exit (alias: `-u`) |
| `-reinstall` | Uninstall, then re-invoke `run.ps1` with no args (alias: `-ri`) |
| `-R` | Run gitmap after build (trailing args forwarded) |

PowerShell flags are case-insensitive, so `-uninstall`, `-Uninstall`, and
`-UNINSTALL` are all equivalent — lowercase is preferred for typing speed.
