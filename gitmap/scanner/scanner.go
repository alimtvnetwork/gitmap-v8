// Package scanner walks directories and detects Git repositories.
//
// The walker uses a small bounded worker pool so independent subtrees are
// crawled in parallel. On large folder trees this is I/O bound and yields
// a meaningful speedup; on small trees the pool collapses to effectively
// sequential work because the dispatch loop short-circuits when only one
// directory is in flight.
//
// Concurrency contract:
//   - Bounded by ScanWorkers (default = runtime.NumCPU(), capped by
//     scanWorkersMax to avoid pathological fd exhaustion on huge trees).
//   - Symlinks are NOT followed (consistent with the previous serial
//     implementation; see spec/01-app/03-scanner.md).
//   - When a `.git` directory is found the parent is recorded as a repo
//     and the subtree is NOT descended further (same rule as before).
//   - The first I/O error from any worker wins and is returned; remaining
//     workers drain and exit. Partial results discovered before the error
//     are still returned so callers can render what was found.
//
// Live progress: callers may pass a Progress callback via ScanOptions to
// observe directory-walked / repo-found counts in near-real time. The
// callback is invoked from a single dedicated goroutine on a fixed cadence
// (see progress.go) so handlers do NOT need to be reentrant or fast — but
// they MUST not block indefinitely or the closing snapshot will be delayed.
